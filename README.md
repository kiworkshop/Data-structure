> "git actually has a simple design, with stable and reasonably well-documented data structures. In fact, I'm a huge proponent of designing your code around the data, rather than the other way around, and I think it's one of the reasons git has been fairly successful […] I will, in fact, **claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important.**" - Linus tovalds
